## Part 2 of the final exam

I am posting here the code for the final exam (which is already uploaded in the webpage) and the Rdata file associated with it, since we do perform some randomization creating the inTrain and the training and test datasets it is always good to have the exact results I have obtained in the analysis of the dataset.
